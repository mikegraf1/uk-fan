Requirements:
Please take the following coding challenge and email your GitHub to mhawkes@examsoft.com and Mike.rueckert@nttdata.com when you have completed your work.

Please note they are not looking for an exhaustive design more something to indicate you know how to work with the things they use on a daily basis.   This should work for both front end and back end.
